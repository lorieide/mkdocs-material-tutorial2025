# Get started with the DaaS API 1.0

DaaS is an API that enables you to integrate with a variety of document rendering engines. 

CDL is moving towards a self-service model so customers can use whatever document solution they choose. You can use DaaS APIs to consume standard outputs, enabling you to integrate new document solutions without needing to develop your own apps. 

With DaaS APIs, you can do the following:

- Use multiple rendering engines simultaneously.
- Store documents in multiple locations, including locations other than FileStore.
- Enable document generation out of the core Strata codebase.
